An environment in dev-team-tools should map 1:1 to your defined environments within your system, e.g. stage to stage, and prod to prod. So for each environment you have, there should be a corrisponding dev-team-tool\u0026rsquo;s environment defined.\nThese must have a unique name within your system, and will be used with the SDK / rest requests so we recommend making them human readable.\nSetting a default # On top of this, you can define a default environment, which is the one you\u0026rsquo;ll load into automatically when navigating to a product. For example if you have defined a stage environment and set it to default, this will be the environment that loads when you initially view your feature switches.\nColours # Setting a colour has no real effect on the system, except making it easier to tell which environment you\u0026rsquo;re currently acting within.
