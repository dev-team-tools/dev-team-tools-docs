# Getting Started

When you first sign up to a company, you'll need to create an account. After you've created an account, you'll be offered a choice:
1. To create a company
2. To join a company

### Creating a company
When creating a company, the name must be unique. Also, you can only be attached one to company at a time.
If you wish to leave a company, please contact us.

### Joining a company
If you've been given a link, please follow it. If you don't already have an account, you will be asked to create one.
You will then be added to the company, and have access to the subscribed products.

## Adding a new user to your company
To add a user to your company and give them access to the subscribed products, you can follow these steps:
1. Login to [dev-team-tools](https://dev-team-tools.com)
2. Head to the [settings](https://dev-team-tools.com/users/settings) page
3. Scroll down to the `Invite User` section
4. Input the email address of the new user
5. Set the `level` of the user
  - Admin, if you'd like them to have elevated permissions to perform actions within the system
  - User, as someone who can use the system and make smaller changes e.g. creating / updating feature switches
6. Copy the link and give it to the person you'd like to add
