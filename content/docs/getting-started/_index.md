# Getting Started
You're either going to be joining dev-team-tools in two different ways:
1. As someone creating the initial company account at dev-team-tools
2. As someone joining a company that's already been set up

So please jump to the appropriate docs.

## Signing up
All users need to sign up before either creating or joining a company. Head to the homepage, and hit the `Login` button. From there, you can create your account.

## Inital sign up and set up
If you're the first person in your company to set up an account at dev-team-tools, you'll be asked to set up a company. Your company cannot be changed once it's been created, so make sure you're happy with the name!

### Inviting users to your company
Once you've created a company, you can invite other users to the company. Head to the [Settings](https://dev-team-tools.com/users/settings#invite) and scroll down to **Invite user**. Add their email address, and click invite. Copy the generated URL, and send that to them. Please be aware that the email provided at this step _must_ match the email they give when signing up. The user _must_ also not already be attached to a company.

Example steps:
1. Login to [dev-team-tools](https://dev-team-tools.com)
2. Head to the [settings](https://dev-team-tools.com/users/settings) page
3. Scroll down to the `Invite User` section
4. Input the email address of the new user
5. Set the `level` of the user
  - Admin, if you'd like them to have elevated permissions to perform actions within the system
  - User, as someone who can use the system and make smaller changes e.g. creating / updating feature switches
6. Copy the link and give it to the person you'd like to add

## Joining a company
Currently, you can only join a company via a generated link. Someone within the company will need to generate a link (see above), and share it with you. Following the link will add you to their company.
Plewase be aware that you can only be attached to one company at a time.
