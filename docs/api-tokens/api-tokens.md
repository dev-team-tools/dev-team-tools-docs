# API Tokens

You can create an API token from the [Settings page](https://dev-team-tools.com/users/settings). These tokens will be used to authenticate you againt our API.

These are signed JWT tokens. They do not contain "secret" information, but they can be decoded to know what permissions they have. You can do this at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)
