# Brag Docs
If you've found yourself here, you're probably wondering what a 'Brag Doc' even is. So on this page, you'll find a break down of what they are, how you could use them, and how you might find them useful.

## What is a Brag Doc?
A Brag Doc (sometimes called a Success Log) is a collection of things you can "brag about". It's a place where you write down your successes, and things you feel proud of. While dev-team-tools is geared for work, there's no reason these should be limited to just work.

You could write about a bit of code that took you ages to get right. You could write about that 5KM run you never thought you'd do. Or about how you pushed back in a meeting and saved the company millions.

That's all they are. No secret sauce. Just a place to record things you're proud of.

## Why are they helpful?
There are two main ways Brag Docs are useful.

The first is personal. People are terrible at remember their successess, but excellent are remembering their failures. A Brag Doc is a great way for you to keep a note of your successes, and to refer to to remind you of all the great things you've done.

They're also excellent come review / promotion time. A lot of people forget (myself included!) all things they've achieved over the year. Being armed with all the code or product successes you've had can help you justify that promotion or pay rise.

## Privacy
We know that bragdocs can be very personal. Thats why we're committed to privacy. These brag docs are yours, not your managers. While they're created in dev-team-tools, they're **only** viewable to your user. They're not shared with anyone else within your company. So rest easy that each brag you write down will be yours alone to look at and refer to later.
